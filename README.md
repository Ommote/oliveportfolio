# oliveportfolio

Hi, welcome to my portfolio site, showcasing all the projects I've built as a developer!

The site is split into three main areas: an about me section, a projects section and a section detailing my tech skills.

As a responsive website, the page is tailored for mobile, tablet and desktop viewing.

Here is a link to my Figma for the site:

My key takeaway from this project is methodology: implement a site's skeleton first and then flesh it out. Also, always build with responsivity in mind!

This project has enabled me to get to grips with CSS and SCSS. I now have a good understanding of Git, and especially of the importance of version control.
